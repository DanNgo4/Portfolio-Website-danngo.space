            "The MainActivity class serves as the entry point of the application. It presents the user with a simple UI to input player names and start the game. The UI is defined in the activity_main.xml layout file and includes: - TextViews for displaying static text, such as the title \"Tic Tac Toe\" and developer's name \"Dan Ngo\". - EditTexts for players to enter their names. - Button to start the game, which is linked to the startGame method. The startGame method retrieves the entered player names, packs them into an Intent, and starts the GameActivity. If no names are entered, defaults (\"Player A\" and \"Player B\") are used.",
            "The GameActivity class is responsible for the core functionality of the Tic Tac Toe game. It includes the following elements: - TextViews for displaying player names and indicating the current turn. - GridLayout containing nine buttons representing the Tic Tac Toe grid. - Button to exit the game and return to MainActivity. The onCreate method initialises the game by setting player names from the Intent, setting up the grid buttons, and indicating whose turn it is. The initiateGame method links the grid buttons to the corresponding array elements.",
            "The game logic is implemented in the gridClick method, which handles button clicks on the grid. This method checks if a grid cell is empty before marking it with \"X\" or \"O\" based on the current player's turn. It then checks for a win or a draw using the checkWin method. - checkWin: This method checks all rows, columns, and diagonals for three matching symbols indicating a win. - updateTurn: Updates the turn indicator. - showMessage: Displays a Toast message announcing the game's outcome. - restartGame: Resets the game state for a new round.",
            "In summary, this project showcases an interactive Tic Tac Toe game for Android, demonstrating fundamental concepts like UI design, event handling, and inter-activity communication using Intents. The game's logic is simple yet effective, providing a basic but complete user experience.",

An Enemy has a Staff as its Weapon and can automatically spawn Fireballs to atack the player. If Hero is hit by a Bug, it loses 10 HP or 10 Armour if it has Armour, this value is 15 if the Hero is hit by a Fireball. The Fireball/Bug will disappear if it hits the Hero, the player will not earn any points from hiding a Bug that makes it disappear. Hero can use its Weapon to destroy these obstacles. Sword can destroy Bugs and Fireballs with 1 hit, but it needs to hit an Enemy twice to kill it. When an Enemy dies, all Fireballs that it has launched will disappear as well. The player will earn 5 points when killed a Bug and 10 points when killed an Enemy. Hero having Bow as its Weapon can launch Arrows to atack the opponents. An Arrow can kill a Bug, but it will be destroyed if hit by a Fireball. Unlike a Sword, an Arrow can kill an Enemy by 1 hit.",

            "When the player’s Score hits 100, a Princess trapped in a Cage will appear, meaning the player’s mission now is to destroy the Cage and rescue the Princess. The Cage can only be hit by a Sword and Hero has to hit it 10 times to rescue the Princess. When the Princess is rescued, it will follow the Hero to enter the Final Round of the game, which is player has to achieve 300 points to win the game. A Princess also has a Weapon, which is a Wand that can randomly launch Spells for the Hero.",

            "When the player wins or loses (HP <= 0), the game will pause, prompt a message as above, along with the 5 most recent scores of the game including the current one, containing the players’ name and score. These records are stored in a text file by the program.",

            "Sessions: The weakest entity in the database, a child table of Class and Student tables, storing the enrollment of students into classes at the university.",

            "The relationships between the entities are as follows:",
            "Convener – Unit: One convener can manage multiple units (1 to Many). Each unit is managed by one convener (1 to 1).",
            "Unit, Room, Tutor – Class: One unit, room, or tutor can be associated with multiple classes (1 to Many). Each class is associated with one unit, room, and tutor (1 to 1).",
            "Class, Student – Sessions: One class or student can be associated with multiple sessions (1 to Many). Each session is associated with one class and one student (1 to 1).",

            "The database design follows normalisation principles (Up to 3NF) to ensure data integrity and reduce redundancy. It was populated with data, and various queries were were written using JOIN and GROUP operations to retrieve specific information from the database:",
            "Query 1: Retrieves detailed information about class sessions with at least one student attending.",
            "Query 2: Retrieves tutors who have classes on Monday.",
            "Query 3: Retrieves all classes ordered by the number of attending students.",
            "Query 4: Retrieves the number of students enrolled in classes of each unit.",
            "Query 5: Retrieves the number of students that each tutor is teaching every week.",

            "In the second part, I used the custom database called “Classes”, which I implemented in the first part of my project. The aim is to migrate this database to a MongoDB database and compare the differences in data storage between the two DBMSs.",

            "In terms of Data Migration, MySQL as a table-based system, organises data into structured tables, facilitating efficient data querying and searching. Creating entities and inserting data in MySQL requires adherence to strict rules regarding primary keys, foreign keys, and data integrity, ensuring a well-defined relational structure. Meanwhile MongoDB is a document-based non-relational DBMS, which provides greater flexibility in handling different types of data, such as unstructured or semi-structured data. Unlike MySQL, MongoDB does not impose strict ordering for creating tables and inserting data. Objects are stored in documents within collections, allowing for a more flexible and dynamic data model.",

            "About Data Storage, Each individual record in MongoDB is stored as a document. These documents, which can contain embedded objects, belong to specific collections. The hierarchical structure of a MongoDB document can be more complex than a row in a MySQL table, allowing for nested data structures. In MySQL, records are stored as rows or tuples in structured tables. All records within a table adhere to the same schema, making data querying straightforward. MySQL's relational model ensures that data is organised in a consistent and predictable manner.",

            "Finally, comparing the data query performance of MySQL and MongoDB can be challenging due to their fundamentally different approaches to data organisation and querying. MySQL is Known for executing high-performance JOIN operations across multiple well-indexed tables, MySQL is efficient at handling complex queries involving multiple tables. While MongoDB supports similar functionality through the $lookup operation, its design philosophy typically minimises the need for joins. By organising data in a hierarchical model and embedding related data within a single document, MongoDB often reduces the necessity for cross-document joins, focusing instead on the flexibility and ease of accessing nested data.",

            "To conclude, I have briefly compared MySQL, a relational database, with MongoDB, a non-relational database, using a database initially designed in MySQL. MongoDB offers greater flexibility in data storage, making it suitable for handling a variety of data types. However, this flexibility may come at the expense of some security and data integrity features inherent to the structured SQL databases like MySQL. The choice between these two powerful DBMSs depends on specific user requirements, organisational needs, and scenarios, highlighting their unique strengths in storing, sorting, and presenting data for software development."
